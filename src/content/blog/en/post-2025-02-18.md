#### How to play GameBoy or GameBoy color games on your Android phone

<br>

What’s up, makina! &#127911;

If you want to have a GameBoy color on your Android smartphone, you need an emulator, like ‘My Old Boy!’ or ‘Pizza Boy C’.

Both of them have free versions, and you can install them from the Play Store by typing ‘My Old Boy Lite!’ or ‘Pizza Boy C Basic’ in the search bar.

Once the app is downloaded, just open it and select the game you want to play. Of course, you can download our game to try it. The demo version will be free, and we will release it at the end of March 2025 on our website and on our <a href="https://playmakina.itch.io" target="_blank">itch.io</a> profile.

I have also made a video tutorial about how to play Game Boy games on Android here: <a href="https://youtu.be/eksJwsSf0KE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
