#### How to extract all dialog texts of your GBStudio project.

<br>

Whatâ€™s up, makina! ðŸŽ§

This tutorial is especially useful in case you need to translate your Game Boy game and need to send all of your dialogues to a translator in a single file.

Place all your dialogues of your GBStudio project in a separate script and call it every time you want to show a dialog to the player.

After that, go to the folder structure of your project and locate your dialogue script in the folder:

```
\project\sprites\YourDialogScript
```
<br>

Finally, use Notepad++ to mark all the text properties of the JSON script and copy all of them to a new file.

I have also made a video tutorial explaining step by step how to do it: <a href="https://youtu.be/SZOEGIWaZAc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>

You can download this demonstration project from here:
