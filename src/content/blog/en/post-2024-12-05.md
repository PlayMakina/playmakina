What's up makina! &#127911;

Since GBStudio version 4.1.0, we have a new feature called "prefabs" to help us develop our Game Boy games faster. In this article you will learn how to use them so that you can make reusable code, which will help you to make your game a lot more organized and speed up your development time in the long run.

We are going to use the original GB Studio template (4-color top-down game) to demonstrate how it works; you can download the resulting project at the end of this article.

<br>

I have also made a video tutorial about how to use prefabs here:

#### Step 0: Check your GB Studio version
Make sure you are using GBStudio version 4.1.0 or above, On the top menu click on

```
Help -> About GB Studio
```
<br>

If your version is 4.1.0 or above, you can continue reading; otherwise, download the latest version first from the official website:

#### Step 1: Understanding prefabs
We are going to look at the black cat located on the "outside" scene. You didn't know, but this female cat was actually pregnant; she gave birth to 3 little kittens.

</p>

Now they are all grown up, and we want to spread them across this scene.
We could do this by copy-pasting our cat multiple times, but what about if after having our copy-pasted cats we want to change the interacting dialog of all of them to say something like, "I'm now part of a big cat family"?

We would have to go cat by cat and change each script manually.

That's why prefabs came to rescue our cats!

We are going to create a single cat prefab so that if we modify it, all our cats will be modified as well.

<br>

#### Step 2: Create a cat prefab
Click on the black cat of the "Outside" scene. Then click on the drop-down arrow next to the cat properties and select "Convert to prefab".
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://www.playmakina.com/blog-post16-02-convert.png" />
</p>

As you can see, there is now a blue section in the properties of our cat with the prefab information, showing this cat is now an instance of the prefab "Actor 1". 

Great! We have created a cat prefab and one instance of it!

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://www.playmakina.com/blog-post16-03-instance.png" />
</p>

Let's create 3 more instances of our cat prefab.
On the bottom left of the screen you will find the PREFABS section; click on the drop-down arrow to expand its content.

The name of our cat prefab is "Actor 1," so click on the + icon and then click somewhere in the "Outside" scene to create 3 more cats.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://www.playmakina.com/blog-post16-04-plus.png" />
</p>

Finally, if we select the "Actor 1" in the prefab section and change the interact text to "I am now part of a big family," we are modifying the cat prefab. So this change will apply to all instances of our cat at once &#9996;
