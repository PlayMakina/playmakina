What's up makinaaaaaaaaas :D

The new monthly episode of _"Los libros de Ellorian"_ is out! In this episode we provide a fresh update on the development state of our videogame.

By the way.. If you pay attention to the background music.. That's Play Makina practicing guitar ;)

In the next month's game review, we will be discussing about: _"Doki Doki Literature Club"_.

Spoiler: For now, all our podcast episodes are only available in Spanish. We are working on a solution to translate them to English. In the meanwhile, I will provide a quick update on the development state of our videogame here: Female character designs are completed and we are now coding the decision tree of the game. One of our goals is to help the user replay the game in a very nice way, so we are adding some functionalities to the decision tree for that :D

**Do not stop the party!**
