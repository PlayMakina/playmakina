What's up makinaaaaaaaaas :D

The new monthly episode of _"Los libros de Ellorian"_ is out! In this episode we provide a fresh update on the development state of our videogame.

This episode includes some sound effect upgrades to keep your positive energy at full power.
By the way.. If you pay attention to the background music.. That's Play Makina practicing guitar ;)

Spoiler: For now, all our podcast episodes are only available in Spanish. We are working on a solution to translate them to English. In the meanwhile, I will provide a quick update on the development state of our videogame here: Female character designs are completed and we are now coding the decision tree of the game. One of our goals is to help the user to replay the game in a very nice way, so we are adding some functionalities to the decision tree for that :D

**Do not stop the party!**
