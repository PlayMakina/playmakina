##### This is a hidden article only accessible by players who have collected the #1 QR in Maki Makulo game.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations on unlocking this achievement! In this article, I walk you through the process of how we made the first level of Maki Makulo. We will also disclose some personal and interesting facts about this game. Take a cup of your favorite drink and enjoy it 😉

&nbsp;

##### What is Rhapsody Beach?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhapsody Beach takes its name from the soundtrack of the level: Rhapsody in Blue.

I encourage you to listen to this masterpiece of music by George Gershwin. Neptuna turns everything blue in the final fight, making a reference to the song title.

&nbsp;

##### Who is Neptuna?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neptuna is the best friend of my 7-year-old son. When my child started designing all the characters, he wanted his best friend to be the first one to rescue. He also wanted all the characters to represent a planet from the solar system, so he chose Neptune for her, representing her blonde and super white skin as if she were coming from a very cold place.

The real world Neptuna is a very clever little girl who will outsmart you if you underestimate her. She has a huge heart inside her and strong values that she will never break.

For this reason, I wanted her fight to be very challenging. When you face her, she will react according to your movements, same as she would do in real life. Your only chance is to first analyze her to find her weak points, which are very few, and move only when she leaves an opening in her stances.

##### For how long have we been working on Neptuna's level?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been working on the demo version of Maki Makulo for 8 months. We have created a solid base from which we can develop the following levels faster.

&nbsp;

##### Why was Game Boy chosen as a platform for this game?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For two main reasons:
- **I wanted my child to touch his own game.** In a world where everything is becoming more and more digital, I wanted him to feel in his fingers the hard work of completing a project. So yes, the full version of Maki Makulo will have a physical cartridge version.
- **It’s a tribute to old-school gaming.** Maki Makulo game is a present for my child. I am putting all my love and effort into this project, I want him to feel how gaming was back in his daddy’s time.

&nbsp;

##### What is your assessment of this game?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maki Makulo is already a huge success. My child has been an active tester since the beginning. I remember exactly the moment when he first played the “almost completed” Neptuna’s level. He was making Maki jump, punch, and move… and after 10 minutes of gameplay, he stopped and told me:

Dad, I love this game.

That’s why this game is a success already. The most important thing to me is that he likes it.

&nbsp;

##### Thank you for playing the first level of Maki Makulo.

**Do not stop the party!**
