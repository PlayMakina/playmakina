What's up makinaaaaaaaaas :D

We introduce you to our new podcast: 'FUGA DE DESCEREBRADOS'. In this episode we discuss with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/antoniogalvezsalm/" target="_blank">Cabronazo</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ellorian_audiolibros" target="_blank">Ellorian</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Akamonte" target="_blank">Akamonte</a> if UFOs are real or a human fantasy.

**BE SURE TO WATCH AFTER THE 1h 52m!** 

Play Makina is doing a quiz game to test your astronomical knowledge!

After the quiz game, we will analyze in an objective way, with real data, if humans are capable of traveling to another planet taking into account 3 possibilities:

1. **1. As of today**
2. **2. In the medium-long term**
3. **3. In our dreams**
